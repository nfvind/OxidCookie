#Cookie Opt out modal window.
Cookie opt out modal, based on ideas from customers projects. It is higly customizeable and can be used on a website with one or more domains showing different content.
The cookie app uses jquery and jquery-ui for smooth animations and for remembering the answer in a cookie :). It also uses a third party lib - js-cookie.
The design of the modal is not very advanced or beatiful but it is designed to be easily customized and redesigned to match induvidual needs.
More information about how to use it, will come later.
